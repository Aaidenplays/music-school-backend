This repo depends on a React front-end repo which can be accessed at this URL: https://github.com/Aaidenplays/frontend-music-school

Welcome to my online music academy app. The purpose of this project is to create an online platform for music instructors to deploy video assignments to their students as well as facilitate consistent communication between students and their instructors.

To use my app just clone this repo and the backend repo provided at the top. Next, type rails db:migrate on the back-end repo then, rails s -p 3001 Finally in the front-end repo type npm install then, npm start

For this project I utilized many models that havent been incorporated yet. The scope of this project is much more than what is provided at the moment. However the features that it does contain are by far the most imporatant. 

This is a rails back-end api that utilizes Active Record for relationships, bcrypt for encrpyting passwords, and serializers to make fetched data requests robust and efficient. 

I hope the app fares well for you as it has me thus far. Thank you for viewing!
